## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. Please treat all contributors and users with respect and kindness.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23+
- Make

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kudora.git
cd kudora

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kudora-labs/kudora.git
```

### Local Node Setup

Follow these steps to build and run a local Kudora node:

#### 1. Build and Install

```bash
make install
```

_Compiles and installs the kudorad binary (Kudora daemon)_

#### 2. Configure PATH

The `kudorad` binary needs to be accessible in your system's `$PATH`:

**MacOS (zsh):**

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Windows:**

```cmd
# Add $(go env GOPATH)\bin to your PATH environment variable
```

**Linux:**

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### 3. Initialize Node with KUD Configuration

````bash
kudorad init Node-1 --chain-id kudora_12000-1 --home ./node-1 --default-denom kud
````

_Creates a new blockchain node and configures KUD as the staking denomination_

#### 4. Create Wallet

```bash
kudorad keys add alice --keyring-backend file --home ./node-1
````

_Creates a new wallet/account named "alice" using file-based keyring storage_

#### 5. Setup Genesis Account

```bash
kudorad genesis add-genesis-account alice 1800000000000000000000000000kud --home ./node-1 --keyring-backend file
```

\_Replace "alice" by her "address"

_Adds Alice's account to the genesis block with 1.8 billion KUD tokens initial balance_

#### 6. Create Genesis Transaction

```bash
kudorad genesis gentx alice 1000000000000000000kud --chain-id=kudora_12000-1 --keyring-backend file --home=./node-1
```

_Creates a genesis transaction where Alice stakes 1 billion KUD to become a founding validator_

#### 7. Collect Genesis Transactions

```bash
kudorad genesis collect-gentxs --home=./node-1
```

_Collects all genesis transactions and incorporates them into the genesis block_

#### 8. Configure Client

```bash
kudorad config set client chain-id kudora_12000-1 --home ./node-1
```

_Sets the default chain ID for client commands_

#### 9. Validate Genesis

```bash
kudorad genesis validate-genesis --home=./node-1
```

_Validates that the genesis file is properly formatted and valid_

#### 10. Enable APIs

Edit `./node-1/config/app.toml` and set:

```toml
[json-rpc]
enable = true

[api]
enable = true
```

_Enables JSON-RPC and API endpoints for interacting with the blockchain_

#### 11. Start Node

```bash
kudorad start --home ./node-1
```

_Starts the blockchain node and begins block production_

This creates a **single-node blockchain network** where Alice is both the sole validator and initial token holder, suitable for local development and testing.

  - Ensures PR titles follow conventional commit format
  - Required for proper changelog generation

- **`link-check.yml`**: Validates all links in documentation
  - Ensures documentation links are not broken
  - Runs on documentation changes

#### Release Workflows

- **`release-binary.yml`**: Builds and releases binary artifacts

  - Triggered on version tags
  - Creates GitHub releases with compiled binaries

- **`docker-release.yml`**: Builds and publishes Docker images
  - Triggered on version tags
  - Publishes to container registry

#### Testing Workflows

- **`interchaintest-e2e.yml`**: Runs end-to-end integration tests
  - Tests full blockchain functionality
  - Validates inter-blockchain communication

#### Deployment Workflows

- **`testnet-hetzner.yml`**: Deploys testnet infrastructure on Hetzner

  - Automated testnet deployment
  - Used for testing releases

### Workflow Requirements

#### For Pull Requests

All PRs must pass these checks before merging:

1. **Unit Tests**: All unit tests must pass
2. **PR Title Format**: Title must follow conventional commit format
3. **Link Check**: Documentation links must be valid (if docs changed)
4. **Code Review**: At least 1 approved review required

#### For Releases

Release workflows are automatically triggered when:

1. A new version tag is pushed (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
2. Binary and Docker image builds must complete successfully
3. All tests must pass before release artifacts are published

### Local Testing

Before submitting a PR, ensure your changes pass locally:

```bash
# Run unit tests (same as CI)
make test

# Run linting (recommended)
make lint

# Format code (recommended)
make format

# Test documentation links (if you modified docs)
make link-check  # if available, or manually verify links
```

### CI Troubleshooting

#### Common CI Failures

1. **Unit Test Failures**

   - Run `make test` locally to reproduce
   - Check test output for specific failures
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly mocked

2. **PR Title Format Failures**

   - Ensure your PR title follows: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
   - Example: `feat(bank): add multi-send support`

3. **Link Check Failures**

   - Verify all documentation links are accessible
   - Update or remove broken links
   - Check for typos in URLs

4. **E2E Test Failures**
   - These test full blockchain functionality
   - May indicate breaking changes
   - Contact maintainers if unsure about failures

#### Getting Help with CI

If you encounter persistent CI failures:

1. Check the workflow logs in the GitHub Actions tab
2. Compare with recent successful runs
3. Ask for help in the PR comments
4. Contact maintainers via GitHub issues
