## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. Please treat all contributors and users with respect and kindness.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23+
- Make

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kudora.git
cd kudora

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kudora-labs/kudora.git
```

### Local Node Setup

Follow these steps to build and run a local Kudora node:

#### 1. Build and Install

```bash
make install
```

_Compiles and installs the kudorad binary (Kudora daemon)_

#### 2. Configure PATH

The `kudorad` binary needs to be accessible in your system's `$PATH`:

**MacOS (zsh):**

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Windows:**

```cmd
# Add $(go env GOPATH)\bin to your PATH environment variable
```

**Linux:**

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### 3. Initialize Node with KUD Configuration

```bash
# Initialize node
kudorad init Node-1 --chain-id kudora_12000-1 --home ./node-1 --default-denom kud

# # Configure KUD as staking denomination
# sed -i '' 's/"stake"/"kud"/g' ./node-1/config/genesis.json
# ```

_Creates a new blockchain node and configures KUD as the staking denomination_

#### 4. Create Wallet

```bash
kudorad keys add alice --keyring-backend file --home ./node-1
```

_Creates a new wallet/account named "alice" using file-based keyring storage_

#### 5. Setup Genesis Account

```bash
kudorad genesis add-genesis-account alice 1800000000000000000000000000kud --home ./node-1 --keyring-backend file
```

_Replace "alice" by her "address"

_Adds Alice's account to the genesis block with 1.8 billion KUD tokens initial balance_

#### 6. Create Genesis Transaction

```bash
kudorad genesis gentx alice 1000000000000000000kud --chain-id=kudora_12000-1 --keyring-backend file --home=./node-1
```

_Creates a genesis transaction where Alice stakes 1 billion KUD to become a founding validator_

#### 7. Collect Genesis Transactions

```bash
kudorad genesis collect-gentxs --home=./node-1
```

_Collects all genesis transactions and incorporates them into the genesis block_

#### 8. Configure Client

```bash
kudorad config set client chain-id kudora_12000-1 --home ./node-1
```

_Sets the default chain ID for client commands_

#### 9. Validate Genesis

```bash
kudorad genesis validate-genesis --home=./node-1
```

_Validates that the genesis file is properly formatted and valid_

#### 10. Enable APIs

Edit `./node-1/config/app.toml` and set:

```toml
[json-rpc]
enable = true

[api]
enable = true
```

_Enables JSON-RPC and API endpoints for interacting with the blockchain_

#### 11. Start Node

```bash
kudorad start --home ./node-1
```

_Starts the blockchain node and begins block production_

This creates a **single-node blockchain network** where Alice is both the sole validator and initial token holder, suitable for local development and testing.
